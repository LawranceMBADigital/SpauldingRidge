# HR Compensation Strategy Analysis – Spaulding Ridge Case Study

Welcome to the repository for my technical assignment as part of the Management Trainee interview process with **Spaulding Ridge**. This project presents a comprehensive analysis and data-driven recommendations focused on improving employee compensation strategies.

---

##  Project Overview

The objective of this case study was to identify and recommend practical Digital Transformation solutions that balance **impact** and **feasibility**, with a focus on retention and compensation. The analysis includes both qualitative visualizations and quantitative evaluations using tools like **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**.

---

##  Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy)** – Data preprocessing and analysis
- **Power BI** – Dashboarding and visualization
- **Excel** – Peer benchmarking, filtering, and compensation adjustments
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Exploratory data analysis and insight generation

---

##  How to Set Up the Database and Run the Application

>  No external database is required for this project. All analysis is done locally using flat files (Excel) and Jupyter Notebook.

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spaulding-ridge-case-study.git
   cd spaulding-ridge-case-study
   ```

2. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open and run the `Spaulding_Ridge_Case_Study.ipynb` file.

3. **Open Power BI Dashboard**
   - Ensure Power BI Desktop is installed.
   - Open `Spaulding Ridge.pbix` for interactive data visualizations.

4. **Use Excel Files**
   - Open any `.xlsx` files directly in Excel to review adjustment logic and recommendations.
